Which Prepaid Plan is Better?

You work as an analyst at a telecommunications company called Megaline. The company offers its clients two types of prepaid plans: the Surf plan and the Ultimate plan. The advertising department wants to know which prepaid plan generates more revenue so they can allocate their advertising budget accordingly.

You will conduct an initial analysis of these prepaid plans based on a relatively small sample of clients. You have data from 500 Megaline clients, containing information such as who they are, where they are from, which plan they use, and the number of calls and messages they sent in 2018. Your task is to analyze user behavior and determine which prepaid plan is more profitable.
